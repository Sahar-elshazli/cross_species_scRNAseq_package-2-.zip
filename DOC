
# Project Writeup: Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis with Seurat & SingleCellExperiment

## Objective
This project compares two pipelines for integrating and analyzing human and mouse single-cell RNA-seq data:
1. Seurat-based pipeline
2. SingleCellExperiment (SCE)-based pipeline

We perform preprocessing, annotation, gene harmonization, and dimensionality reduction in both frameworks.

## Summary
- Harmonized mouse-human gene names
- Integrated UMAP analysis
- Manual cluster annotation on human cells
- DE-ready object outputs

See README.txt for how to reproduce our experiments.
